\title{Load 'request' logs from specified directory.}
\usage{
load.requests(dir, filename.pattern, sheet = NULL, validate = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dir}{Directory which should be searched for files.}

\item{filename.pattern}{String with a regex pattern which will be passed to `list.files` to match files,
however: '^' (string start) is added at the start of the pattern, and ".*\\.xlsx" is added at the end,
so effectively files that will be loaded must be XLSX and have names that start with the provided pattern.
The pattern should not contain .xlsx file specification. This will break the pattern recognition}

\item{sheet}{Optional parameter passed to `read_xlsx`, defaults to NULL (first sheet of an Excel workbook)}

\item{validate}{Should the file be validated (make sure that only one of TEI columns is filled.)}
}
\value{
Your request file in the tibble format
}
\description{
Searches `dir` to find XLSX files with names that start with a match for `filename.pattern`.
NB: This pattern-matching is case-insensitive. If files contain the classic "TRUE", "EXISTING" or "INVALID" (TEI) columns,
these will be renamed to "true.v", "existing.v", and "invalid.v" respectively and optionally validated for errors.
